## Project Description
E-Commerce ORM uses sequelize to make the use of mysql that much smoother and efficient compared to just using SQL and building the tables in .sql. This project has no front end, just back-end, so a database made with routes.js and seeds.js files and models for each table. The database is accessed through Insomnia by submitting a GET, PUT, DELETE, or POST request. 

## Installation Instructions
